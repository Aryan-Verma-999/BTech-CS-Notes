MODALS & CONDITIONALS

Modals in conditional sentences


In first conditional sentences, we use a simple present tense in the if-clause and will + infinitive in the main clause. This is the standard form. Alternate forms with other auxiliaries are also possible. Note that first conditional forms with modals express ideas such as permission, advice, future possibilities etc.
